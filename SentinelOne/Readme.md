### Step 1: Log into SentinelOne
`Start Here:` Open your web browser and head to the SentinelOne console URL provided by your organization.

`Sign In:` Enter your credentials to log in. If you’ve got multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled (which is a good idea!), go ahead and verify your login.
### Step 2: Find the Threats
`Go to the Threats Section:` After you log in, look for the "Threats" option in the menu on the left.

`Search & Filter:` To make things easier, use the filters to sort through incidents by date, threat type, status, or even specific agents.
### Step 3: Dive into the Details
`Pick a Threat:` Click on any threat that catches your eye to see all the juicy details.

`Check the IoCs:` Look through the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) like file hashes, IP addresses, URLs, and file paths. These are your clues to what’s happening.

`Threat Type:` See how the threat is classified. Is it malware? Ransomware? Something else? Also, take note of any MITRE ATT&CK techniques that SentinelOne has flagged.
### Step 4: Follow the Timeline
`Timeline Tab:` Click on the `Timeline` tab to see what’s been happening in order.

`Process Flow:` Check out the process tree to understand how things unfolded, including which processes were kicked off by which.

`Spot Anything Weird?:` Look out for any unusual behavior—things like `unauthorized access`, `unexpected script execution`, or `strange network connections`.
### Step 5: Dig Deeper
`File Analysis:` If you find any suspicious files, download them and run them through other tools for further analysis—whether that’s a sandbox environment or some manual digging.

`Use Threat Intelligence:` Compare the `IoCs` you’ve found with `threat intelligence feeds`, either within SentinelOne or from external sources.

`Look for Patterns:` See if there are any related incidents or patterns that could give you more context.
### Step 6: Contain and Fix the Problem
`Contain the Threat:` If you confirm something nasty is going on, use SentinelOne’s `Network Quarantine` or `Kill` options to stop it in its tracks.

`Clean Up:` Use the `Remediate` or `Rollback` options to clean up any damage or restore affected files and systems.

`Strengthen Your Defenses:` Adjust your security policies if needed to prevent this type of threat from slipping through again.
### Step 7: Report and Record
`Generate a Report:` Use SentinelOne’s built-in tools to create a detailed report of what you’ve found and what you did about it or use external tools.

`Document Your Work:` Make sure to document the steps you took, what you found, and any recommendations for the future.

`Share Your Findings:` Send the report to the necessary teams—like IT, management, or other security folks who need to know.
### Step 8: Review What Happened
`Post-Incident Review:` Once everything is under control, review the incident to spot any gaps in your defenses.

`Update Playbooks:` If you learned something new, update your incident response playbooks so you’re even better prepared next time.

`Root Cause Analysis:` Dig deep to figure out how this threat got in and what you can do to stop it from happening again.
### Step 9: Keep an Eye on Things
`Continuous Monitoring:` Keep monitoring your network to make sure everything stays clean and there are no signs of the threat coming back.

`Proactive Threat Hunting:` Stay ahead by actively searching for potential threats that might be lurking unnoticed.
### Step 10: Share Your Knowledge
`Contribute to the Community:` If you found something interesting or unique, consider sharing your findings with the wider cybersecurity community.
Update Your GitHub: Document this process, along with any specific cases or lessons learned, and share them on your GitHub page. This helps others and showcases your skills!
