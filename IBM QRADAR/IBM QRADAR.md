# 1. Introduction
### Overview of IBM QRadar
Briefly introduce IBM QRadar as a leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.
Highlight its capabilities in detecting, investigating, and responding to threats in a security environment.
### Objective of the Guide
State that this guide will cover the end-to-end process of investigating a security incident using IBM QRadar, from identifying a potential threat to closing the investigation.
# 2. Preparation and Setup
### Step 1: Accessing IBM QRadar
`Login:` Describe the process of logging into IBM QRadar.

`Dashboard Overview:` Give a quick overview of the main dashboard elements such as the offense tab, log activity, and network activity.
# Step 2: Understand the Environment
`Assets & Network Hierarchy:` Understand the environment, focusing on the network hierarchy, assets, and offense types commonly observed.

`User Roles:` Ensure the correct user permissions for conducting investigations.

# 3. Identifying and Investigating an Offense
### Step 3: Monitor Offenses
`Offense Dashboard:` Explain how to navigate to the Offense tab to view ongoing offenses.

`Offense Details:` Click on an offense to view detailed information such as source IP, destination IP, associated rules, and time of occurrence.

### Step 4: Analyzing the Offense
`Initial Triage:` Prioritize offenses based on severity, relevance, and potential impact.

`Related Events:` Look at the raw events or flows associated with the offense. This helps understand the context.

`Filtering Events:` Use filters to narrow down to specific events of interest.

`Correlations:` Analyze how events correlate to trigger the offense. Investigate if this is a false positive or a genuine threat.

### Step 5: Drill Down into Events
`Log Activity:` Use the `Log Activity` tab to analyze the raw logs associated with the offense.

`Search:` Use the advanced search feature to filter events by IP address, username, event name, etc.

`Custom Views:` Create a custom view to focus on specific types of log entries.

`Network Activity:` If the offense involves network traffic, use the "Network Activity" tab to investigate the flow data.

Flow Analysis: Examine the flow details, such as source and destination IPs, ports, and protocols.
# 4. Determining the Root Cause
### Step 6: Use QRadar's Tools for Deeper Analysis
`AQL (Advanced Query Language):` Use AQL to run detailed queries across logs and flows to uncover patterns or anomalies.
Reference Sets: Check for any reference sets that might contain blacklisted IPs, URLs, or other indicators of compromise (IoCs).
### Step 7: Correlate Findings
`Asset Information:` Investigate the asset involved in the offense. Check for vulnerabilities or recent changes that might have contributed to the incident.

`User Activities:` Correlate the offense with user activities, including login attempts, privilege escalations, or suspicious behaviors.

`Threat Intelligence Integration:` If QRadar is integrated with threat intelligence feeds, compare the offense indicators with known threat signatures.

# 5. Responding to the Incident
### Step 8: Containment and Remediation
`Contain the Threat:` Suggest steps for immediate containment, such as blocking IPs or disabling user accounts.

`Remediation:` Provide recommendations for remediation, such as patching systems, updating firewall rules, or enhancing security policies.

### Step 9: Document the Findings
`Reporting:` Generate and export reports from QRadar that summarize the offense, findings, and actions taken.

`Case Documentation:` Ensure all findings, including screenshots, AQL queries, and remediation steps, are documented in a case file.

# 6. Closing the Case
### Step 10: Review and Close the Offense
`Review:` Ensure all aspects of the investigation have been thoroughly documented and that no further actions are required.

`Close the Offense:` Mark the offense as closed in QRadar, providing a reason and summary for closure.

# Step 11: Post-Incident Analysis
`Lessons Learned:` Conduct a post-incident review to identify gaps in detection or response.

Recommendations: Propose enhancements to improve future incident detection and response efforts.
# 7. Conclusion
`Recap:` Summarize the investigation steps, from identifying an offense to closing the case.

`Final Thoughts:` Emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, proactive threat hunting, and the value of IBM QRadar in a security operations environment.

### 8. Sample Case Study (Optional)
Provide a hypothetical or sanitized real-world example of an incident investigation using QRadar to illustrate the process.
